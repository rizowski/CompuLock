	Notes:
		- Grabbing processes and who owns the current ones is slow, perhaps in future updates the process retrieval could be improved by implementing other method described in the codeproject resource.
		- Grabbing the current history as it is being made would be easier. This way I can get around trying to find each db file there is for every browser out there. The proxy server can also be applied to 1 account at a time. This is useful because I don't want to track every account that is logged in. I just want to listen to the account that is specified.
		- The proxy approach is very difficult, currently I am running into issues with other protocols. As  soon as you turn it into a proxy you have to deal with any and all requests. I am having issues with trying to make it so that it handles HTTPS correctly.
