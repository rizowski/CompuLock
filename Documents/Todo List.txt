	Notes:
		- Grabbing processes and who owns the current ones is slow, perhaps in future updates the process retrieval could be improved by implementing other method described in the codeproject resource.
		- Grabbing the current history as it is being made would be easier. This way I can get around trying to find each db file there is for every browser out there. The proxy server can also be applied to 1 account at a time. This is useful because I don't want to track every account that is logged in. I just want to listen to the account that is specified.
		- The proxy approach is very difficult, currently I am running into issues with other protocols. As  soon as you turn it into a proxy you have to deal with any and all requests. I am having issues with trying to make it so that it handles HTTPS correctly.



Week 2: 
	- Change a selected userâ€™s password
		Notes:
			- Method should be implemented.
	- Change a selected users password based on a time limit
		Notes:
			- For some reason they gave an option to lock an account programatically but so far they don't have a way to unlock it. A little confused on that.
	- Unlock an account with a master password
		Notes:
			- With this I don't really need a master password. The new password should be sent via email to the parent or something of this sort. After the password is changed I can send this somehow to the parent.
	- Error handling for the above
		Notes:
	- Unit testing for password changes and master password

					Notes:
						- From what I have been able to tell I might be able to find out session information for a user by doing the following things
						- I can query into the WMI which I will seem to do quite a bit. I can then use the data it returns to find out user information.
						- The problem I am running into is actually trying to find the right table to find all the data I need.
						- once I get it set up I can actually make a data object that will do all the queries for me. Everything below will help with these Notes
