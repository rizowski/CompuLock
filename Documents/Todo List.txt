Pulls from the server first, then pushes.

	- Switched over to visual studio 2010 onto XP
	- Got a partial gui going started to develop custom service
	- Added timers for computer account and History
	- found and implemented a custom login checker function

Week 9:
	Todo:
		Database:
			- |DOne| Add update commands. There is a problem with using Insert on conflict replace
				- it is causing the ID to change which wont change it for everything it has a relationship with.
		RestManager:
			- Timer for pushing data from the desktop Db to the webservice on a regular basis
		ProcessManager:
			- |Done| Find out why the stupid thing put me into yellow for week 8 and fix its defect.
			- possibly rewrite the get processes method to get processes with users easier
		HistoryManager:
			- Only works for general use. Find if there is a difference between accounts and fix.
		MainService: 
			- Needs to function as if there is no web until a user object has an auth token.
		Gui:
			Desktop:
				- Gui needs to function as an independant application not requiring the web until an auth token is provided
			Web:
				- A simple layout needs to be established to show the information in a readable manor. Doesn't need to be fantastic
		Todo:
			SQLite:
				- Trigger for updating count History
		Issues:
			SQLite:
			- is closing the connection FOR SOMEREASON prematurely on actions to the db.
				- nothing on google about the error
				- most sources out dated.
			- is being called out of sequence when introduced with a gui
			- is now being called out of sequnce with out gui but is less frequent
			Settings:
				- Updating a user authtoken after there is one already there. unique constraint error
Check Up Goals:
	- who do I want to become and how will i get there.
Side Things to accomplish:
	- Add Day and hour of day Restrictions
	- Need to write update statements - Id for conflicting items is going up

Notes for Presentation:
	As for browser history I can use a proxy to get all the information
	As for account being associated with the history I can get the currently logged in user
	Learned unmanaged dll calls
